## Drone Communication Jamming – Detection & Prevention
Approaches: ML | RL | CNN

This repository serves as an umbrella project showcasing my work on detecting and preventing RF jamming attacks on drone communication systems.
It combines multiple approaches — from classical ML to reinforcement learning to deep learning — with synthetic datasets simulating jammer activity.

## Sub-Projects

# [Detection & Prevention (ML + Double Greedy Algorithm)](https://github.com/priyanshchandr/drone_jamming_prevention)

Built a Random Forest–based detection model for jamming signals.
Implemented a double-greedy channel allocation algorithm to minimize interference.

# [RL Control for Jammer Mitigation](https://github.com/priyanshchandr/JammerDetectionAndRLControl)

Designed a Q-learning agent that learns optimal mitigation strategies.
Demonstrates decision-making under uncertainty.

# [CNN-Based Real-Time Detection](https://github.com/priyanshchandr/Drone_jamming_detection)

Trained a convolutional neural network to classify jammed vs. normal signals.
Integrated live inference and visualization for real-time detection.
